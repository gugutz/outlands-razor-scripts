# PAIN SPIKE ON NEARBY CORPSES
# by gugutz

# This script finds corpses within X tiles from char (configurable)
# and if it finds, it will cast pain spike on it, and then ignore it
# It will also clear the target queue before casting, to avoid wasting the target
# on queued self or queued on other objects

@setvar find_corpses_range 5

# if findtype 'corpse' ground any any find_corpses_range as corp
hotkey 'Clear Target Queue'
say '[painspike'
waitfortarget 1000
    # if targetexists 'harmful'
    #     target corp
    # endif
    # @ignore corp
# else
#     overhead 'no corpses to explode'
# endif
